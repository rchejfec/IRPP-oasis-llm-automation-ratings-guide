You'll typically need to find the correct model identifier string for your chosen provider (e.g., `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`, `google/gemini-1.5-pro-latest`).

It is crucial to be critical of the outputs, especially when using lighter models for testing, as was done here for demonstration. While DSPy provides a more reliable prompting structure, choices regarding the Signature design, the specific LLM used, and its configuration parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.) can all influence the final ratings. More research is required to validate these methods and understand the optimal approaches for this type of assessment.\n",
